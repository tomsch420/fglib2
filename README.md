# Welcome to the fglib2 package!

Factor Graphs are a powerful tool for probabilistic machine learning. Unfortunately, there are no modern libraries 
implementing them. This package improves the original fglib package by adding a richer documentation and a more 
refined implementation.

Install the package via

``
    pip install fglib2
``

Read the docs TODO.
