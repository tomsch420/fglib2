   walkthrough


fglib2 provides a fast and flexible package for creating and manipulating factor graphs.
fglib2 is based on the implementation of the `original fglib package <https://github.com/danbar/fglib>`_
by Daniel Bartel.
While the functionality of the package is similar to the original fglib, the implementation is improved.

The topic of factor graphs is best understood through `Phillipp Henning's Lecture on YouTube.

`random_events <https://random-events.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package.
